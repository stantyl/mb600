The company installs and services the machines for customers.Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.Current environment -Overview -Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.Accounting system - The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality. Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers. Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.Other systems - The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles. The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized. The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.Requirements -General requirements - The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized. Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements. You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines. Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.Quality inspection app -Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.Inspection orders - Inspection orders must:- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.",
